# Involved
## Become a Resource

## About

Involved is an application aimed at connecting individuals to the
problem of homelessness. By signing up, you can begin to offer
help through the form of openning your home, donating food, clothes,
and toys to local events, and volunteering.

## Why Get Involved?

The more you help, the more local coupons, deals, and prizes become
available to you! When you donate your time, energy, and resources,
we reward you with points that can be used to purchase coupons
provided by businesses and organizations. It's a win-win!

## How do I Signup?

Register here. In order to protect the individuals and organizations
involved, we require you sign up with a verified email address and
visit your local center in order to get started.
